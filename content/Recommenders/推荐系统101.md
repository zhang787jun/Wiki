Recommender systems are widely employed in industry and are ubiquitous in our daily lives. These systems are utilized in a number of areas such as online shopping sites (e.g., amazon.com), music/movie services site (e.g., Netflix and Spotify), mobile application stores (e.g., IOS app store and google play), online advertising, just to name a few.

The major goal of recommender systems is to **help users discover relevant items** such as movies to watch, text to read or products to buy, so as to create a delightful user experience. Moreover, recommender systems are among the most powerful machine learning systems that online retailers implement in order to drive incremental revenue. 

Recommender systems are replacements of search engines by reducing the efforts in proactive searches and surprising users with offers they never searched for. Many companies managed to position themselves ahead of their competitors with the help of more effective recommender systems. As such, recommender systems are central to not only our everyday lives but also highly indispensable in some industries.

## Component

Component Procedures of a Recommender:
Recommenders mostly have 3 components:
1. `Candidate Generations`: This method is responsible for generating smaller subsets of candidates to recommend to a user, given a huge pool of thousands of items.
2. `Scoring Systems`: Candidate Generations can be done by different Generators, so, we need to standardize everything and try to assign a score to each of the items in the subsets. This is done by the Scoring system.
3. `Re-Ranking Systems`: After the scoring is done, along with it the system takes into account other additional constraints to produce the final rankings.
